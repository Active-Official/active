# Ruby Binding SPEC (CHECKLIST Phase 2, PROPOSAL section 2.1)

Status: Planned (no toolchain on this machine; design recorded, implementation deferred until a toolchain is available for proof).

Mechanism: Ruby FFI gem.

FFI bindings over the cdylib: opaque pointers as FFI::AutoPointer with releasers wired to the matching free; ABI gate at require time; errors raise typed Ruby errors. No Ruby toolchain on this machine: SPEC only.

Ownership mapping: every active_* owned return is freed exactly once with its matching free function; diagnostic codes are borrowed and never freed; modules stay thread-confined per docs/FFI.md. Agent-loop surface (check, eval, diagnostics with codes) mirrors bindings/python/active.py one to one. Full manifest wiring follows the Go smoke pattern once implemented.
